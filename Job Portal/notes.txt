Login and Logout:

I am using Spring logout and I have customized my login form to use spring security.
In application context , using <form-login> attributes

Also I have customized both the queries of jdbc-service for user validation.


URL:

I have implemented url security for admin and user pages. 
I am cheking if user is logged in by setting access to authenticated and
checking the particular role for the url is allowd.

Method:

I am using PostAuthorize annotation for authorization 
Making sure that only admin or user of the application or rwviewer can view the page
